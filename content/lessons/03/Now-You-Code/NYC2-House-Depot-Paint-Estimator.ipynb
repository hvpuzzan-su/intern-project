    "The big-box hardware store *House Depot* as contracted you to write an App to estimate the amount of paint required to paint a room. Given that 1 gallon of paint covers 400 square feet, you must output the number of paint cans required to paint a rectangular room.\n",

    "The program should input:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the length of the room in feet, \n",
    "- the width of the room in feet,\n",
    "- the height of the room in feet\n",
    "\n",
    "The program should output:\n",
    "\n",
    "- total area to be painted ( sum of each of the 4 walls)\n",
    "- the number of gallons of paint required to paint the room.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Enter length of room: 12\n",
    "Enter width of room: 14\n",
    "Enter height of room: 8\n",

    "```\n",

    "HINT: Use the `math.ceil()` function to round your number of gallons up to the nearest whole number \n"

    "1. Why does the program still run when you enter a negative number for length?\n",
    "Because python recognizes negative numbers\n",
    "2. Does the output make sense when you enter a negative length? Why type of error is this?\n",
    "No it does not make sense, this is a logic error because python only reads the code written not the question being asked\n",
    "3. Why do we use `math.ceil()` in this program? In other words are you allowed to buy 3.75 gallons of paint?\n",
    "Because you would need to purchase a certain number of full gallons, you can't buy partial gallons, so you need the program to round up to ensure you buy enough paint. \n"

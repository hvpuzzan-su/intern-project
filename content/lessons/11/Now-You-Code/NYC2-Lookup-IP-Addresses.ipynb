    "# Now You Code 2: IP Addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "For this Now You Code, you will complete a very common task in data analytics: converting an IP address https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address to an approximate location.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to read the IP Addresses from the File `NYC2-IP-Addresses.txt` and for each IP address determine the approximate location (City and State) for the origin of that IP Address. This is usually done as part of analytics to determine the origins of website visitors. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform the lookups, use the http://freegeoip.net API. **You'll have to read through the API documentation first and understand how to use the API before you write the program. **\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, problem simplification is key here.  Just get the  IP lookup working, writing it as a function, and then try to read from the file and perform the lookups for each IP address in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a sample of a geoip lookup of the IP Address `'128.230.182.217'`\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "{'city': 'Syracuse',\n",
    " 'country_code': 'US',\n",
    " 'country_name': 'United States',\n",
    " 'ip': '128.230.182.217',\n",
    " 'latitude': 43.0377,\n",
    " 'longitude': -76.1396,\n",
    " 'metro_code': 555,\n",
    " 'region_code': 'NY',\n",
    " 'region_name': 'New York',\n",

    " 'zip_code': '13244'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example the city and state would be `Syracuse, NY`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Final Program Output will read all the addresses from the file.:\n",

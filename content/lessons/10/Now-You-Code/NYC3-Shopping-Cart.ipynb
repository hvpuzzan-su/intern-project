    "The program should loop continually,  asking the user to enter \n",
    " - Product name\n",
    " - Product price\n",
    " - Product quantity\n",
    "\n",
    "until the user enters a product name of `'checkout'` at which time the loop should break.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time through the loop you should create a dictionary of product name, product price and product quantity then add the dictionary to a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you enter `'checkout'`  the program should show:\n",
    "\n",
    " - all the items in the cart, including their quantity and price\n",
